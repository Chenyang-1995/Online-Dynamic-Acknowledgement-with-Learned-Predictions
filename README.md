#The Dynamic TCP Acknowledgement Problem

This is the code for the paper "Online Dynamic Acknowledgement with Learned Predictions".

# Requirements

Python >= 3.6.11

scipy >= 1.5.4

matplotlib >= 3.3.1


#Experiments

Our algorithms are coded in ``algorithm.py``. 
File ``pdla_algorithm.py`` and ``pdla_function.py`` are provided by  [`PDLA`](https://github.com/etienne4/PDLA) implementation.
File ``draw.py`` provides a function which could be useful when drawing figures for the experiments.


To do the experiments, run

```
python test.py
```
